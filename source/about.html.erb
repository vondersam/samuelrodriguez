      I’m a full stack web developer based in Uppsala, Sweden. In 2015, I started teaching myself how to code and a year later I took a bootcamp in web development at Le Wagon, Brussels. During the last three weeks of the course and together with three other developers, I started Bookaround, an application to sell and exchange books locally. I'm currently studying computational linguistics at Uppsala Universitet.

      I am  especially interested in Computational Linguistics, machine learning and any tech with a positive social and environmental impact.
